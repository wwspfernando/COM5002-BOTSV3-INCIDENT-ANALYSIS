SOC Investigation Using Splunk (BOTSv3 Dataset)

This project presents a comprehensive Security Operations Center (SOC) investigation conducted using Splunk Enterprise and the Boss of the SOC Dataset Version 3 (BOTSv3). The investigation focuses on identifying suspicious system behavior, executable misuse, and potential malicious activity within a simulated enterprise environment. Using structured log analysis and correlation techniques, multiple stages of attacker behavior were examined, including command execution, process creation, and user-related activity.

The analysis was performed by executing targeted SPL queries to identify abnormal usage of Windows native utilities such as cmd.exe, wmic.exe, and powershell.exe, which are commonly abused in “Living-off-the-Land” (LotL) attacks. Visualizations, statistical analysis, and filtered search results were used to highlight execution patterns, process relationships, and time-based activity anomalies. Supporting evidence was extracted directly from Splunk and exported as CSV files to ensure investigation transparency and reproducibility.

All findings are documented in the accompanying SOC Investigation Report, along with relevant screenshots and exported Splunk results. This repository includes the report, investigation screenshots, exported CSV evidence files, and a collection of SPL queries used during the analysis. Together, these artifacts demonstrate a complete end-to-end SOC investigation workflow aligned with modern threat detection and incident analysis best practices.
